Recently, I had upgraded my Macintosh machine from version 10.8.5 to 10.9.2 (Mavericks) and **immediately** noticed some issues with it.

Notably, many of my binaries were no longer working that I had installed with `brew`.

If you see these issues, yaou can fix it in one commnd...

```sh
brew update && brew upgrade
```

Once you do this, you'll notice that your binaries that you had installed with `brew` now work again!
